Problem 4:
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
"""
# I wrote my own method for checking if a number is a palindrome. I thought that the number should read the same
# from the start to its middle digit, and from the end to its middle digit in reverse, so that's what my function checks.
# Later I learned that there are much more concise ways to do this... but anyways...
